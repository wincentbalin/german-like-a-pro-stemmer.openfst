From https://developer.s24.com/blog/german_stemming_like_a_pro.html:

Besides a list of known words, the HyphenationCompoundWordTokenFilter 3 needs a hyphenatation definition. It is compatible with the old Apache Offo Hyphenation definition. Download offo-hyphenation_v1.2.zip from Sourceforge and locate the hyph/de.xml in the package. Use this as hyphenator input to the token filter.
